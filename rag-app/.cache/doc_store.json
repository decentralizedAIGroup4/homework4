LDP Primer provides an entry-level introduction with\\nmany examples in the context of a fictional application. LDP Best Practices and Guidelines discusses best\\npractices that you should use, and anti-patterns you should avoid, when constructing these clients and servers.\\nThis specification defines a special type of Linked Data Platform Resource: a Container. Containers are very\\nuseful in building application models involving collections of resources, often homogeneous ones. For example,\\nuniversities offer a collection of classes and a collection of faculty members, each faculty member teaches a\\ncollection of courses, and so on. This specification discusses how to work with containers. Resources can be\\nadded to containers using standard HTTP operations like POST (see section 5.2.3 HTTP POST).\\nThe intention of this specification is to enable additional rules and layered groupings of rules as additional\\nspecifications. The scope is intentionally narrow to provide a set of key rules for reading and writing Linked\\nData that most, if not all, other specifications will depend upon and implementations will support.\\nThis specification provides some approaches to deal with large resources. An extension to this specification\\nprovides the ability to break large resource representations into multiple paged responses [LDP-PAGING].\\nFor context and background, it could be useful to read Linked Data Platform Use Case and Requirements [LDP-\\nUCR] and section 6.

Linked Data Platform Containers\\n5.1 Introduction\\nThis section is non-normative.\\nMany HTTP applications and sites have organizing concepts that partition the overall space of resources into\\nsmaller containers. Blog posts are grouped into blogs, wiki pages are grouped into wikis, and products are\\ngrouped into catalogs. Each resource created in the application or site is created within an instance of one of\\nthese container-like entities, and users can list the existing artifacts within one. Containers answer some basic\\nquestions, which are:\\n1. To which URLs can I POST to create new resources?\\n2. Where can I GET a list of existing resources?\\n3. How do I get information about the members along with the container?\\n4. How can I ensure the resource data is easy to query?\\n5. How is the order of the container entries expressed? [LDP-PAGING]\\nThis document defines the representation and behavior of containers that address these issues. There are multiple\\ntypes of containers defined to support a variety of use cases, all that support a base set of capabilities. The\\ncontents of a container is defined by a set of triples in its representation (and state) called the containment triples\\nthat follow a fixed pattern. Additional types of containers allow for the set of members of a container to be\\ndefined by a set of triples in its representation called the membership triples that follow a consistent pattern (see\\nthe linked-to definition for the possible patterns). The membership triples of a container all have the same\\npredicate, called the membership predicate, and either the subject or the object is also a consistent value – the\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"4NjHm99JifUZPUALn0FjXet3v7chDav+y5V+LCRjJtU=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"5ec97c0c-0581-4f84-b017-687ea1021b76":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"5ec97c0c-0581-4f84-b017-687ea1021b76\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"total_pages\":38,\"file_name\":\"linkeddataplatform1_d4a725a1-7fd6-4b8e-95e3-838159b417d1.pdf\",\"private\":\"true\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"remaining position of the membership triples (the one that varies) define the members of the container. In the\\nsimplest cases, the consistent value will be the resource's URI, but it does not have to be. The membership\\npredicate is also variable and will often be a predicate from the server application vocabulary or the\\nldp:member predicate.\\nIn LDP 1.0, there exists a way for clients to request responses that contain only partial representations of the\\ncontainers. Applications may define additional means by which the response representations contain a filtered set\\nof data and including (or excluding) additional details, those means are application-specific and not defined in\\nthis document.\\nThis document includes a set of guidelines for creating new resources and adding them to the list of resources\\nlinked to a container. It goes on to explain how to learn about a set of related resources, regardless of how they\\nwere created or added to the container's membership. It also defines behavior when resources created using a\\ncontainer are later deleted; deleting containers removes membership information and possibly performs some\\ncleanup tasks on unreferenced member resources.\\nThe following illustrates a very simple container with only three members and some information about the\\ncontainer (the fact that it is a container and a brief title):\\nRequest to http://example.org/c1/:\\nExample 1\\nGET /c1/ HTTP/1.1\\nHost: example.org\\nAccept: text/turtle\\nResponse:\\nExample 2\\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\\nContent-Type: text/turtle\\nDate: Thu, 12 Jun 2014 18:26:59 GMT\\nETag: \\\"8caab0784220148bfe98b738d5bb6d13\\\"\\nAccept-Post: text/turtle, application/ld+json\\nAllow: POST,GET,OPTIONS,HEAD,PUT\\nLink: <http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#BasicContainer>; rel=\\\"type\\\",\\n<http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Resource>; rel=\\\"type\\\"\\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\\n@prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>.\\n@prefix ldp: <http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#>.\\n<http://example.org/c1/>\\na ldp:BasicContainer;\\ndcterms:title \\\"A very simple container\\\";\\nldp:contains <r1>, <r2>, <r3>.\\nThe preceding example is very straightforward: there are containment triples whose subject is the container,\\nwhose predicate is ldp:contains, and whose objects are the URIs of the contained resources, and there is no\\ndistinction between member resources and contained resources.

Direct\\nContainers allow membership triples to use a subject other than the container itself as the consistent membership\\nvalue, and/or to use a predicate from an application's domain model as the membership predicate.\\nLet's start with a pre-existing domain resource for a person's net worth, as illustrated immediately below, and\\nthen see how a Container resource can be applied in subsequent examples:\\nRequest to http://example.org/netWorth/nw1/:\\nExample 3\\nGET /netWorth/nw1/ HTTP/1.1\\nHost: example.org\\nAccept: text/turtle\\nResponse:\\nExample 4\\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\\nContent-Type: text/turtle\\nDate: Thu, 12 Jun 2014 18:26:59 GMT\\nETag: \\\"0f6b5bd8dc1f754a1238a53b1da34f6b\\\"\\nLink: <http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource>; rel=\\\"type\\\",\\n<http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Resource>; rel=\\\"type\\\"\\nAllow: GET,OPTIONS,HEAD,PUT,DELETE\\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\\n@prefix ldp: <http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#>.\\n@prefix o: <http://example.org/ontology#>.\\n<http://example.org/netWorth/nw1/>\\na o:NetWorth;\\no:netWorthOf <http://example.org/users/JohnZSmith>;\\no:asset\\n<assets/a1>,\\n<assets/a2>;\\no:liability\\n<liabilities/l1>,\\n<liabilities/l2>,\\n<liabilities/l3>.\\nIn the preceding example, there is a rdf:type of o:NetWorth indicating the resource represents an instance\\nof a person's net worth and a o:netWorthOf predicate indicating the associated person.

Existing domain-specific applications\\nexist that depend on those types and predicates, so changing them incompatibly would be frowned upon.\\nIt would be helpful to be able to use LDP patterns to manage the assets and liabilities-related triples. Doing so\\nusing a Basic Container would require duplicating much of the information with different types and predicates,\\nwhich would be onerous for large resources. Direct Containers provide a middle ground, by giving LDP clients a\\nway to map existing domain-specific resources to LDP's types and interaction models.

For example, if the client POSTs content to a\\ncontainer that causes the container to create a new , and that content contains the triple ( <> ,\\nfoaf:primaryTopic , bob#me ) foaf:primaryTopic says that the member-derived-URI is bob#me.

Certain specific cases exist where a server might delete a resource and then later re-use\\nthe URI when it identifies the same resource, but only when consistent with Web architecture.

In\\ncases where the provided authentication fails to meet the requirements of a particular access control policy, the\\n403 status code (Forbidden) can be sent back to the client to indicate this failure to meet the access control\\npolicy.\\nA.

specification describes the use of HTTP for accessing, updating, creating and deleting resources from\\nservers that expose their resources as Linked Data.It provides clarifications and extensions of the rules of\\nLinked Data [LINKED-DATA]:\\n1.Use URIs as names for things\\n2.Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names\\n3.When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards (*, )\\n4.Include links to other URIs, so that they can discover more things\\nThis specification discusses standard HTTP and techniques used when constructing clients and servers that\\ncreate, read, and write Linked Data Platform Resources.LDP Primer provides an entry-level introduction with\\nmany examples in the context of a fictional application.LDP Best Practices and Guidelines discusses best\\npractices that you should use, and anti-patterns you should avoid, when constructing these clients and servers.This specification defines a special type of Linked Data Platform Resource: a Container.Containers are very\\nuseful in building application models involving collections of resources, often homogeneous ones.For example,\\nuniversities offer a collection of classes and a collection of faculty members, each faculty member teaches a\\ncollection of courses, and so on.This specification discusses how to work with containers.Resources can be\\nadded to containers using standard HTTP operations like POST (see section 5.2.3 HTTP POST).The intention of this specification is to enable additional rules and layered groupings of rules as additional\\nspecifications.The scope is intentionally narrow to provide a set of key rules for reading and writing Linked\\nData that most, if not all, other specifications will depend upon and implementations will support.This specification provides some approaches to deal with large resources.An extension to this specification\\nprovides the ability to break large resource representations into multiple paged responses [LDP-PAGING].For context and background, it could be useful to read Linked Data Platform Use Case and Requirements [LDP-\\nUCR] and section 6.Notable information from

header's\\nreturn=representation preference [RFC7240] is:\\ninclude-parameter = \\\"include\\\" *WSP \\\"=\\\" *WSP ldp-uri-list\\nWhere WSP is whitespace [RFC5234], and ldp-uri-list is a double-quoted blank-delimited\\nunordered set of URIs whose ABNF is given below.The generic preference BNF [RFC7240] allows\\neither a quoted string or a token as the value of a preference parameter; LDP assigns a meaning to\\nthe value only when it is a quoted string of the form:\\nldp-uri-list = DQUOTE *WSP URI *[ 1*WSP URI ] *WSP DQUOTE\\nwhere DQUOTE is a double quote [RFC5234], and URI is an absolute URI with an optional\\nfragment component [RFC3986].7.2.2.2 The omit hint defines a subset of a 's content that a client would like omitted from a\\nrepresentation.The syntax for the omit parameter of the HTTP Prefer request header's\\nreturn=representation preference [RFC7240] is:\\nomit-parameter = \\\"omit\\\" *WSP \\\"=\\\" *WSP ldp-uri-list\\nWhere WSP and ldp-uri-list are defined as above for include.7.2.2.3 When LDP servers receive a request with conflicting hints, this specification imposes no\\nrequirements on their behavior.They are free to reject the request, process it applying some subset of the\\nhints, or anything else appropriate to the server.[RFC7240] suggests treating similar requests as though\\nnone of the conflicting preferences were specified.7.2.2.4 This

the year 2563, when humanity reached beyond the known stars, a legend was born from the darkest corners of the gamma quadrant.His name was feared across the galaxies, whispered in the cargo holds of interstellar freighters and sung in the rowdy alien taverns on distant planets.He was P1R4T3YOHO123, the most notorious pirate of the cosmos, captain of the legendary vessel known as the Star-Potato.The Star-Potato was no ordinary ship.It was crafted from a unique alloy that shimmered like the rings of Saturn under the cosmic sun.Equipped with quantum engines, photon sails, and an AI with a peculiar fondness for old Earth sea shanties, the Star-Potato could outrun any imperial cruiser or mercenary gunship.But what truly set P1R4T3YOHO123 and his crew apart was their unyielding pursuit of a treasure unlike any other: the galactic bananas.Galactic bananas, as legend had it, were fruits of incredible power, capable of granting immortality or healing any disease.They were said to grow in the heart of the Neblar Forest, a nebula where space and time twisted in impossible ways, guarded by the Keepers, ancient beings as old as the universe itself.Many had tried to claim these mystical fruits, yet none had returned.Undeterred by tales of peril, P1R4T3YOHO123 set his course for the Neblar Forest.The journey was perilous, through asteroid fields that danced like deadly pirouettes and past black holes that yearned to devour the unwary.Yet, under P1R4T3YOHO123's cunning command and with the Star-Potato's unmatched speed, they reached the edge of the Neblar Forest.As they ventured deeper, reality began to warp around them.Stars bent, and the fabric of space itself seemed to whisper in a language forgotten by time.It was then that they encountered the Keepers.These beings, made of starlight and shadow, challenged P1R4T3YOHO123, demanding to know why he sought the galactic bananas.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"jwZGYguQVfNIV7gzFOYmodrAWlH+T0Hw8m++zEZqnXQ=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"c35b4b29-d5bc-4eac-a32b-321949ae7a66":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"c35b4b29-d5bc-4eac-a32b-321949ae7a66\",\"metadata\":{\"file_name\":\"ShrekScript_2762ed91-1373-4a7c-bddd-86421bde1332.txt\",\"private\":\"true\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"817ca520-ff77-4d15-be19-06cc203925a1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_name\":\"ShrekScript_2762ed91-1373-4a7c-bddd-86421bde1332.txt\",\"private\":\"true\"},\"hash\":\"g7sfnZBAb31OoWnS+VI2ZL1O1UeOvyG5hNudha/r26U=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"237fb64a-885f-468a-89ce-32503d414e87\",\"metadata\":{\"file_name\":\"ShrekScript_2762ed91-1373-4a7c-bddd-86421bde1332.txt\",\"private\":\"true\"},\"hash\":\"jwZGYguQVfNIV7gzFOYmodrAWlH+T0Hw8m++zEZqnXQ=\"}},\"text\":\"With

   to stay, but - - Don't do that!That's \\n                         my tail!That's my personal tail.You're \\n                         gonna tear it off.I don't give permission \\n                         - - What are you gonna do with that?Hey, now.No way.No!No!No, no!No.No, no, no.No!Oh!Shrek grabs a chain that's connected to the chandelier and swings \\n               toward the dragon.He misses and he swings back again.He looks \\n               up and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head.He pulls on the chain and it releases and he falls down and bumps \\n               Donkey out of the way right as the dragon is about to kiss him.Instead the dragon kisses Shreks' butt.She opens her eyes and \\n               roars.Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto \\n               her head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms \\n               a sort of collar for her.She roars again and Shrek and Donkey \\n               take off running.Very 'Matrix' style.Shrek grabs Donkey and \\n               then grabs Princess Fiona as he runs past her.DONKEY\\n                         Hi, Princess!FIONA\\n

      a descending slide and jumps on.But unfortunately there is a \\n               crack in the stone and it hits Shrek right in the groin.His \\n               eyes cross and as he reaches the bottom of the slide he stumbles \\n               off and walks lightly.SHREK\\n                         Oh!Shrek gets them close to the exit and sets down Donkey and Fiona.SHREK\\n

standards (*, )\n4.Include links to other URIs, so that they can discover more things\nThis specification discusses standard HTTP and techniques used when constructing clients and servers that\ncreate, read, and write Linked Data Platform Resources.LDP Primer provides an entry-level introduction with\nmany examples in the context of a fictional application.LDP Best Practices and Guidelines discusses best\npractices that you should use, and anti-patterns you should avoid, when constructing these clients and servers.This specification defines a special type of Linked Data Platform Resource: a Container.Containers are very\nuseful in building application models involving collections of resources, often homogeneous ones.For example,\nuniversities offer a collection of classes and a collection of faculty members, each faculty member teaches a\ncollection of courses, and so on.This specification discusses how to work with containers.Resources can be\nadded to containers using standard HTTP operations like POST (see section 5.2.3 HTTP POST).The intention of this specification is to enable additional rules and layered groupings of rules as additional\nspecifications.The scope is intentionally narrow to provide a set of key rules for reading and writing Linked\nData that most, if not all, other specifications will depend upon and implementations will support.This specification provides some approaches to deal with large resources.An extension to this specification\nprovides the ability to break large resource representations into multiple paged responses [LDP-PAGING].For context and background, it could be useful to read Linked Data Platform Use Case and Requirements [LDP-\nUCR] and section 6.Notable information from

were originally taken from [POWDER] appendix D, and then modified to comply\nwith the current registration template.The pre-LDP IANA link relation registry entry for describedby refers\nto a different section of [POWDER] that was substantively updated in an erratum, and that section was not\nactually the normative definition of the link relation.Since we expect no update to [POWDER] that incorporates\nthe erratum or fixes the registry link, this superseding registration approach is being taken.The following Link Relationship will be submitted to IANA for review, approval, and inclusion in the IANA\nLink Relations registry.Relation Name:\ndescribedby\nDescription:\nThe relationship A describedby B asserts that resource B provides a description of resource A.There\nare no constraints on the format or representation of either A or B, neither are there any further constraints\non either resource.Reference:\nThe Linked Data Platform specification.Notes:\nDescriptions of resources may be socially sensitive, may require processing to be understood and may or\nmay not not be accurate.Consumers of descriptive resources should be aware of the source and chain of\ncustody of the data.Security considerations for URIs (Section 7 of RFC 3986) and IRIs (Section 8 of RFC\n3987) apply to the extent that describing resources may affect consumers' decisions about how or whether\nto retrieve those resources.9.Security Considerations\nThis section is non-normative.As with any protocol that is implemented leveraging HTTP, implementations should take advantage of the many\nsecurity-related facilities associated with it and are not required to carry out LDP operations that may be in\ncontradistinction to a particular security policy in place.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"BcHJlVeStON3awMMqLb2BX24DZa3Qmhencuth1Wm7jQ="},"6cf21222-3a4a-4065-895e-4881a235b899":{"id_":"6cf21222-3a4a-4065-895e-4881a235b899","metadata":{"page_number":35,"total_pages":38,"file_name":"linkeddataplatform1_d4a725a1-7fd6-4b8e-95e3-838159b417d1.pdf","private":"true"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"e8514b95-2df1-473e-a038-80904b7eda10","metadata":{"page_number":35,"total_pages":38,"file_name":"linkeddataplatform1_d4a725a1-7fd6-4b8e-95e3-838159b417d1.pdf","private":"true"},"hash":"DSWzbDA3+MNCNq0sojqi7qwOWe/zs0m8g0Myr9B87TI="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"21033276-691f-41c1-810c-39f780cd7ecd","metadata":{"page_number":35,"total_pages":38,"file_name":"linkeddataplatform1_d4a725a1-7fd6-4b8e-95e3-838159b417d1.pdf","private":"true"},"hash":"BcHJlVeStON3awMMqLb2BX24DZa3Qmhencuth1Wm7jQ="}},"text":"For
